# DestructiveClip

An Inkscape Extension which works like Object|Clip|Set except that the paths clipped are actually **modified**.

Thus the clipping is included when exported, for example as a DXF file.
Select two or more **paths** then choose Extensions|Modify path|Destructive clip. The topmost path will be used to clip the others.

Notes:-

- Curves (including Arcs) in paths are not supported (use Extensions|Modify path|Flatten Beziers).
- Non-path objects in the selection will be ignored. Use Object|Ungroup.
- Paths entirely outside the clipping path will remain untouched (rather than modifying them to an empty path)
- Complex paths may take a while (there seems to be no way too show progress)
- Yes, using MBR's to do gross clipping might make it faster
- No, Python is not my first language (C/C++ is)

# To install

Copy destructiveclip.py & destructiveclip.inx into Inkscape\share\extensions where-ever Inkscape is installed (eg Program Files).
Start Inkscape. "Destructive Clip" should now be available under the Extensions menu, in the Modify Path submenu.

# Example

clipped.png shows the rectangular blue path clipping the tiled "dovetail" red path. The red path has been _modified_
